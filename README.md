# RailwayOptSitePos

This repository reflects the implementation of an algorithm based on a paper that is set to appear. Please note that the contents of this repository are currently under development and may undergo changes as we refine the implementation to align with the paper. We encourage you to keep an eye on this repository for updates.

# Description

The code in this repository aims to replicate the algorithm described in the forthcoming paper. Our intention is to provide a practical implementation that can be utilized and tested by the community. As such, please consider this code as a work in progress, subject to further modifications and improvements.


# USAGE

## Julia and DrWatson 
This code base is using the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) and
[DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> RailwayOptSitePos

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.add("DrWatson") # install globally, for using `quickactivate`
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box, including correctly finding local paths.

You may notice that most scripts start with the commands:
```julia
using DrWatson
@quickactivate "RailwayOptSitePos"
```
which auto-activate the project and enable local path handling from DrWatson.


##  Simulated Data:

      julia scripts/model_sim.jl


## Real World Data: 
   
   julia scripts/model_solvit.jl
